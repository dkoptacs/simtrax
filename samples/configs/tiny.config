# Example configuration file
# See https://code.google.com/p/simtrax/wiki/Configfiles for more info
#
# Example latencies given are from 65nm synthesis from Synopsis and Cacti
#
# Each line specifies a unit
#   First item is unit name
#
#   Functional units:
#     Second item is unit latency (cycles)
#     Third item is number of units per TM
#     Tiny example has 1 of each unit
#
FPADD 2 1
FPMIN 1 1
FPCMP 1 1
INTADD 1 1
FPMUL 2 1
INTMUL 1 1
FPINV 16 1
CONV 1 1
BLT 1 1
BITWISE 1 1

#   Memory units:
#     Second item is unit latency (cycles)
#       MEMORY latency is only used if "--disable-usimm" argument is specified to simtrax
#     Third item is capacity in words
#     Fourth item is number of banks (only for L1/L2)
#     Fifth item is log_2 of line size in words (only for L1/L2)
#       **L1 and L2 line sizes must match!**
#     Shown example creates a 1-cycle L1 with 32768-byte capacity, 4 banks, and (2^4) words (64-byte) line size
#     Shown example creates a 2GB main memory taking 50 cycles (if usimm disabled)
#   
L1 1 8192 4 4
MEMORY 50 536870912
L2 3 131072 8 4
